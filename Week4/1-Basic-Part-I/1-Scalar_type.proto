    bytes can be used for storing any data in binary format like in this example we are using it for storing the small image

    if the field value is not defined or unknown then it will take the default values
    bool: false
    string: empty string
    number(int32..., etc) = 0
    bytes: empty bytes
    enum: first Value
    repeated: empty List
